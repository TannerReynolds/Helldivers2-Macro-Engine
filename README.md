This program contains macros for various stratagems to use. All macros are contained in the macro_engine.exe program, and you can specify which macro is the one that runs by adding the name of the stratagem as an argument when launching the program.

## Streamdeck How-To

* First, we need to install this plugin from the elgato marketplace: https://marketplace.elgato.com/product/advanced-launcher-d9a289e4-9f61-4613-9f86-0069f5897125
* Once installed, drag in an "Advanced launcher" from this plugin.
* Then, you need to download the .exe file from the releases tab in this repository: https://github.com/TannerReynolds/Helldivers2-Macro-Engine/releases
    * *Alternatively, you can choose to build the exe from the source code yourself.*
* Once downloaded, set the "Application" to the "macro_engine.exe" you just downloaded.
* Check the box at the bottom that says "Run in background" (required to work in-game)
* And finally, type in the stratagem name in the "arguments" section

### Additional Options
* Arrow Key Support
    * If you would like to use arrow keys, just put "arrows" **after** the first argument. Example: `hellbomb arrows`
* No Control/Holding down the key for you
    * If you would like to press or hold the strategem menu key down yourself, use `no_ctrl` **after** the first argument. You can use this alongside `arrows` as well. Example 1: `hellbomb no_ctrl`, Example 2: `hellbomb arrows no_ctrl`

*The recommended setup is to change your bind for bringing up the strategem menu, so that you only need to press it, rather than hold it. Then, you want to use the `no_ctrl` option, and press the button yourself before using a macro. I have found this to be the most reliable method of getting macros working.*

*Keep in mind: This method is not 100%, the failure rate is actually pretty high, regardless of what the key press timings are. I am not sure why.*

*Your anti virus might flag this program, this is because the author (me) is unknown, and because this program sends keyboard inputs on your behalf.*

## Custom commands
In place of a named command, you can type `+` followed by any combination of `wasd`. For example, `+swaswdsw` would call the Hellbomb the same as `hellbomb` would. Use this in case new stratagems get added.
